We will become familiar with the core data types built into Python, some standard functions we will frequently use, and learn how to define our own functions. By the end, you should have a solid grasp on core Python concepts, be prepared to study the next notes on programming structures and numerical programming, and feel comfortable handling data."

    "- Comment frequently. Leaving short notes not only will help others who use your code, but will also help you interpret your code after some time has passed.\n",
    "- Anytime you use a comma, place a space immediately afterwards.\n",
    "- Whitespace is your friend. Don’t write line after line of code – use blank lines to break it up.\n",
    "- Don’t let your lines run too long. Some people reading your code will be on a laptop, so you want to ensure that they don’t need to scroll horizontally and right to read your code. We recommend no more than 80 characters per line."
