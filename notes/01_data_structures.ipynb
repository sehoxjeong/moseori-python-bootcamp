    "In this note, we begin with the basics. We learn about core concepts of programming like variables and data structures. We will become familiar with the core data types built into Python, some standard functions we will frequently use, and learn how to define our own functions. By the end, you should have a solid grasp on core Python concepts, be prepared to study the next notes on programming structures and numerical programming, and feel comfortable handling data."
